Animal Wordle is a Wordle clone that only includes 5-letter animals! The game begins with an empty board and a secret winning animal. The goal is to guess the animal in as few attempts as possible. To guess; use the on-screen keyboard or type a 5-letter animal and press enter. The color of your guess will change to reveal how close you are to the winning word. If a letter is in the winning word and placed correctly, it turns green. If a letter is in the winning word but placed incorrectly, it turns yellow. If a letter isn't in the winning word it turns gray. Use that feedback to make your next guess!

The game has two difficulty levels: easy and hard. The default setting is easy. The easy dictionary contains commonly known animals. The hard dictionary contains every 5-letter vertebrate I could find.

### Additional Game Guidelines:

 The game will not accept words that are not in the animal dictionary. The 'Play Guide' outlines the dictionary parameters.
